# Reflection on my Intended Design
Follow the instructions and write the report in this file.

The only classes that i missed were human player, consoleUI, property, free and start tile respectively and game. Mainly absent because i didnt understand correctly more about interface and abstract classes, also i did not implement enumeration or protected classes in my initial diagrams, the lack of enumeration is due to my lack of knowledge about it at that time as well as protected classes but now i learned that enumeration can help keep things shorter.

There were no extra classes due to mainly me interpreting the classes with help from the game scenario provided. Also because i thought the ones i provided would be sufficient to make the game work but reflecting on it now the classes i missed were important in my opinion and i will use it for future reference and improvement.

most classess i drew have the same name as the ones provided with the excpetion of the ones missing due to again following the game scenario provided in assign 2. i believe that classes should be appropiately named to match their purpose so as to facilitate user understanding i.e if a class is named interface then i can assume that the class holds methods and attributes related to a interface and just the interface leaving me to understand what that class does.

My design does possess some differences in relationships for example my board generates the board and the tiles are held differently in a class or method i do not understand completly mainly because i used the blackjack excercise from the coding sessions which reflecting on it was a dumb mistake, i also did not make many relations due to again not having enough knowledge and having difficulty understanding parts of it.

The classes were conencted via Id connections. I did not understand completely at the time the arrows and connections which is why i mainly resorted to id connections upon research and perhaps my connections are incorrect and looking on it now i would make some changes.

The behaviour is divived nicely between classes, my dice class takes care of the dice functions nicely, there is also the player class taking care of his actions, the board generates the playing board, then there is tiles and finally the interface which takes care of a lot of actions. So i believe i managed to divide the complexity and behaviour.

For the most part the object diagrams looks simmilar in naming but differ due to mainly different relationships such as my design lacking the prev var and due to also not having classes that the provided diagram possess for example i did not add game due to me thinking that since the interface takes the action there would be no need for game but now after seeing and understanding the provided diagram i would make some changes.

My sequence diagram is smaller but similar i believe in concept, for example i show the dice roll two times with one dice instead of showing two also lacking the getvalue it also lacks game and it-s related actions, my design is also  much less detailed, my designed missed a few marks and i think it would be better by taking into consideration what i missed, some things i missed no next round or a proper loop.

I believe i did a decent job in the object diagram and class diagram, it could be attributed to me having an idea of which classes and methods would be employed, i am dissapointed in my sequence diagram and believe i could do better, i also believe the three diagrams are difficult to understand and read and confusing overall, the best move i could've done was do more research and understand more about diagrams.

The most important things i learned are that the best way to move forward is to first know what are you going to do and how, so i learned that designing first gives a scope of how things should end up looking and how they should be working. I feel it was a good way to practice and after seeing for the first time the provided diagrams i understood what marks i missed and where i could improve but overall i need to do more research
